    <h2>About ART-DE-LIGHT</h2>

    <div class="text-block">
        <h3>ART-DE-LIGHT — the Art of Light, Glass, and Emotion</h3>

        <p>Since childhood, I have been fascinated by stained-glass windows in historic buildings.
        I could spend hours watching how sunlight passed through the colored glass, scattering vivid reflections across the walls and filling the space with a warm, almost magical glow. These windows came alive through light alone — long before electricity existed.</p>

        <p>That feeling — the wonder of simple sunlight transforming space — stayed with me throughout my life.</p>

        <p>Many years later, in a world where artificial light is always available, an idea emerged:
        What if I could bring that ancient beauty into a contemporary form?
        What if I could create art that breathes with light — both day and night?</p>

        <p>That is how the story of ART-DE-LIGHT began.</p>

        <h3>A Modern Interpretation of Inspiration</h3>

        <p>I started working with glass, epoxy resin, contour lines, and internal lighting — blending craftsmanship, design, and technology.
        Each piece carries the transparency of stained glass, the layered depth of resin, and the gentle illumination of a built-in light-box that reveals the artwork from within.</p>

        <p>Light became my “artificial sun,” allowing the piece to be admired at any moment.</p>

        <h3>A Dual Nature: With Light and Without It</h3>

        <p>My artworks have two distinct expressions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Without the light-box — they appear as expressive standalone paintings.</li>
            <li>With the light-box turned on — they transform into radiant light panels that reshape the atmosphere of the room.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This dynamic nature makes each piece feel alive.
        They can enhance any interior — a home, office, lounge, hotel, or gallery — and instantly change the mood of a space.</p>

        <h3>Handcrafted and Truly Unique</h3>

        <p>Every ART-DE-LIGHT piece is created entirely by hand, using techniques that make each artwork one of a kind.
        The flow of epoxy resin, the texture of the glass, the interplay of colors, and the hand-shaped contours ensure that no piece can ever be replicated exactly.</p>

        <p>Even if I attempt to recreate a design, the natural behavior of the materials and the creative process itself make each artwork unique, with its own personality and energy.</p>

        <p>This uniqueness is at the very heart of the brand.</p>

        <h3>Both Artwork and Light Object</h3>

        <p>ART-DE-LIGHT pieces are designed to function on two levels:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>as a painting, viewed as a traditional artwork,</li>
            <li>and as an illuminated panel, serving a decorative and functional purpose.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This duality makes the artwork a part of the architecture — not just decoration.</p>

        <h3>My Style: Contours, Color, and Depth</h3>

        <p>A defining element of my technique is the use of thin wire to create clean, sculptural contours.
        These lines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>enhance clarity and expression,</li>
            <li>structure the composition,</li>
            <li>separate and protect the colors of the resin,</li>
            <li>and create a modern stained-glass-inspired effect.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>They act as a guiding framework of light — shaping the artwork and giving it depth.</p>

        <h3>The Philosophy of ART-DE-LIGHT</h3>

        <p>I believe that art should not only decorate — it should energize.
        Each of my pieces reflects an emotion, a memory, a journey, or a moment of inner clarity.
        My intention is to create art that brings warmth, harmony, and inspiration into any space.</p>

        <p>My guiding principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>✨ Art should bring joy.</li>
            <li>✨ Art should offer tranquility or spark emotion.</li>
            <li>✨ Art should illuminate — both visually and spiritually.</li>
            <li>✨ Art should become part of one’s living space and inner world.</li>
            <li>✨ And above all: art should be authentic and unique.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The name ART-DE-LIGHT was born from this belief:
        art that brings light.</p>

        <p>If one of my works resonates with someone’s heart, the mission is fulfilled.</p>
